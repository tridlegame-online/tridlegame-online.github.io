                                    While the three words are carefully selected each day, they are typically independent 
                                    of each other. This independence adds to the challenge, as you can't rely on thematic 
                                    connections to solve the puzzles. However, the words are chosen to ensure a fair and 
                                    engaging gameplay experience, with each puzzle being solvable within the given attempts.

                                    Tridle stands out with its unique triple-puzzle mechanic, where every guess impacts 
                                    three separate word puzzles simultaneously. This innovative approach requires players 
                                    to think strategically about each guess, considering its potential impact across all 
                                    three grids. The game combines the familiar enjoyment of word puzzles with an added 
                                    layer of strategy and complexity.
